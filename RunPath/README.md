# Sandbox

A simple web api to retreive some data and merge into a queryable object

To use run the project and query as http://localhost:2480/api/albums to get list of all albums
or pass in parameter http://localhost:2480/api/albums/4 to filter by user


There is also a unit test project with a mock repository would form the basis of developing with TDD
